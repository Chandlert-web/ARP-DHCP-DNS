# Core Network Services: ARP, DHCP, and DNS

This repository demonstrates practical understanding of foundational network services and how their failures present in real-world environments.

---

## ARP

**Issue**  
Intermittent or localized connectivity failures.

**Explanation**  
ARP maps IP addresses to physical device addresses.

---

## DHCP

**Issue**  
Devices connect but cannot access the network.

**Explanation**  
DHCP assigns IP address, gateway, and DNS configuration.

---

## DNS

**Issue**  
Internet access works, but internal systems fail by name.

**Explanation**  
DNS translates names into IP addresses.
