Problem Description

Teachers reported that laptops and tablets were able to connect to Wi-Fi, but students experienced intermittent access to instructional platforms, slow logins, and failures reaching internal systems by name.

The issue affected multiple classrooms but not the entire district.

Initial Assessment (Core Services Suspected)

Because:

Devices were physically connected

Wireless association was successful

Failures were inconsistent and application-specific

This pointed away from physical or switching issues and toward core network services:
DHCP, DNS, and ARP.

Step 1: Validate DHCP Address Assignment
Command (Client Side)
ipconfig /all

Expected Output
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 169.254.32.18
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :
DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes

Explanation

169.254.x.x indicates APIPA

Device did not receive a lease from DHCP

No gateway assigned → device cannot route traffic

Confirms DHCP failure

Step 2: Validate DHCP Scope Availability (Network Side)
Command
show ip dhcp binding

Expected Output
IP address      Client-ID/Lease expiration
10.10.50.1      0100.1a2b.3c4d.5e
10.10.50.2      0100.1a2b.3c4d.5f
...

Explanation

Scope is nearly exhausted

New devices cannot obtain leases

Explains intermittent behavior across classrooms

Corrective Action: Restore DHCP Availability
Action Taken

Expanded DHCP scope

Cleared stale leases

clear ip dhcp binding *


Configuration actions do not return output. Validation follows.

Step 3: Revalidate DHCP Assignment
Command
ipconfig /all

Expected Output
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.50.42
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.50.1
DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.1.10

Explanation

Device now has a valid address

Correct subnet and gateway

DHCP service restored successfully

Step 4: Validate DNS Resolution
Command
nslookup internal-portal.school.local

Expected Output
Server:  dns01.school.local
Address: 10.10.1.10

Name:    internal-portal.school.local
Address: 10.10.60.15

Explanation

DNS server is reachable

Name resolves correctly to an IP

Rules out DNS failure for this request

Step 5: Validate ARP Resolution (Local Connectivity)
Command
arp -a

Expected Output
10.10.50.1      00-1c-73-9a-b4-22     dynamic

Explanation

Gateway MAC address successfully resolved

Confirms Layer 2–Layer 3 handoff

No ARP cache instability present

Resolution Summary
Technical Summary

The issue was caused by DHCP scope exhaustion, which prevented devices from receiving valid network configuration. After restoring DHCP availability and validating DNS and ARP behavior, normal connectivity and application access were restored.

Non-Technical Summary

Devices were connecting to Wi-Fi but were not receiving the information needed to fully access the network. Once that information was restored, access returned to normal.

Key Takeaway

Core network services may fail silently, but their impact is immediate and widespread. Validating DHCP, DNS, and ARP early prevents misdiagnosis and unnecessary changes.
